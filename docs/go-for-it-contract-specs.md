Token Contract
===========

The token contract implements a ERC20 standard token. It is named ??? Token.
Ticker symbol will be ???.
The number of decimals will be 18 to keep the resolution identical to ETH.

The token contract emits the standard ERC20 events including a transfer event to address 0x0 in case of minting tokens.

We rely on the broadly trusted Open Zeppelin v1.12.0 implementation of an ERC20 compliant Token. The following extensions are used:


Capped and Mintable
-------------------

Tokens are minted on demand by the Crowdsale contract.
Therefore the ownership of the token contract has to be transferred to the token sale contract. The minting of tokens is capped at 12,500,000,000.

Pausable
--------

Transfer of tokens is paused on construction of the token contract.
Transfer of tokens is unpaused on finalization of the token sale
contract. No transfer of tokens is possible until finalization of the token sale.

Owned
-----

Minting and pausing functions are restricted to the token contract owner. The ownership of the token contract is transferred to the Crowdsale contract immediately after deployment.
The ownership of the token contract remains with the Crowdsale contract after finalization, so the Token will not be Pausable or mintable after finalization.


Token Sale Contract
===================

The Token sale contract is a Minted and Finalizable Crowd sale from the Open Zeppelin framework (v1.12.0).

Post KYC crowd sale
-------------------

The token sale contract uses a new scheme for KYC verification. Every investor is able to invest ETH into the crowd sale but tokens are only minted after the KYC of the sending address is verified.
If an unverified investor sends ETH, tokens are not minted but the amount of pending tokens will be stored and issued when the address is verified by the owner of the token sale contract as long as the token cap of the sale is not exceeded.
The verification should process multiple addresses in one transaction.
Once an address is verified it can invest and the token purchase will be processed instantly. Investors who send ETH and do not provide KYC information or investors that do not meet KYC requirements, can withdraw their investment after the end of the token sale.


Set Rate
--------

The token sale contract provides a function that enables the token
contract owner to set the Token price at any time. The
price represents the Token per ETH rate. With a target
price of 0.05 $ per MERO we will have a rate of
approximately 9,000 according to a price of approximately 115 $ per ETH.
There is a sanity check, that allows to change the rate only by one order of magnitude up or down.


Token pools
-----------

  |Pool            |           Cap |distribution time                         |
  |----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
  |private sale    | 5,511,842,425 | any time before end of the Crowdsale     |
  |public sale     | 1,250,000,000 | between start and end date of Crowdsale  |
  |Bounty          |   181,250,000 | at finalization to company wallet        |
  |Team            | 1,100,000,000 | at finalization into vesting contract    |
  |Company         | 3,369,407,575 | at finalization into vesting contract    |
  |Advisors        | 1,087,500,000 | at finalization to company wallet        |
  |Token Cap       |12,500,000,000 |                                          |




Private sale
---------------

At any time before the end of the Crowdsale, tokens can be issued to private presale investors by the owner of the token sale contract. The token sale contract can process a lists containing the amounts of tokens assigned to presale buyer addresses.


KYC verification
----------------

After the end of the Crowdsale investors have time to pass the KYC requirements until the finalization function is  called.


Finalization
------------
Company tokens will be minted to a vesting contract that will release the token after 12 month. Advisor  tokens will be minted to the company MultiSig wallet. Team  tokens will be minted to to a vesting contract that will release the token after 24 month. Bounty tokens will be minted to an wallet controlled by the company to distribute to bounty receipients. Further minting of tokens in token contract is disabled. Transfers are unpaused in token contract. The ownership of the token contract is not transferred. The token sale contract is useless from now on. The token contract has no owner capable of acting, which means the token is not pausable.
It is possible to prolong the KYC period by waiting with the call of the finalization function.

MultiSignature Wallets
======================
There will be two Multisignature contracts deployed. One for the main wallet where the Ether of the Crowdsale will be send to. The other one will store the team token.

Vesting contracts
=================
The Company Token will be send to a vesting contract that will release the token after 12 month when called by the company multisignature wallet.
